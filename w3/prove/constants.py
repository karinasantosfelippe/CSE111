"""
    Unlike other programming languages like C, C++, Java; Python does not contain any constants.
    Instead, Python provides us a Capitalized naming convention method.
    Any variable written in the Upper case is considered as a Constant in Python.

    ConstantError will be generated if you attempt to update the constant value.
    You can also set dict and list values to the const module to make them uneditable.
    Unlike a variable, deleting option is disallowed for constants
