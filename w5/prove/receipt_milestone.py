Problem Statement:
    A local grocery store subscribes to an online service that enables its customers to order groceries online. After a customer completes an order, the online service sends a CSV file that contains the customerâ€™s requests to the grocery store. The store needs you to write a program that reads the CSV file and prints to the terminal window a receipt that lists the purchased items and shows the subtotal, the sales tax amount, and the total.
