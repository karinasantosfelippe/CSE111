"""
Author: Karina Santos Felippe
Assignment:
    Write a Python program named sentences.py that generates simple English sentences. During this prove milestone, you will write functions that generate sentences with three parts:
        a determiner (sometimes known as an article)
        a noun
        a verb
    For example:
        A cat laughed.
        One man eats.
        The woman will think.
        Some girls thought.
        Many dogs run.
        Many men will write.
    For this milestone, your program must include at least these five functions:
    1. main
    2. make_sentence
    3. get_determiner
    4. get_noun
    5. get_verb
    You may add other functions if you want. The functions get_determiner, get_noun, and get_verb, must randomly choose a word from a list of words and return the randomly chosen word. All the functions that you must write for this milestone assignment are described in the Steps section below.
