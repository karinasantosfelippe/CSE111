# Fixtures - Pytest Docs:
#   When pytest goes to run a test, it looks at the parameters
#   in that test functionâ€™s signature, and then searches for fixtures
#   that have the same names as those parameters. Once pytest finds 
#   them, it runs those fixtures, captures what they returned (if
#   anything), and passes those objects into the test function as arguments.
