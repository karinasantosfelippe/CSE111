''' EXAMPLES '''

# Example 1
# Create variables of different data types and then
# print the variable names, data types, and values.

a = "Her name is "  # string
b = "Isabella"      # string
c = a + b           # string plus string makes string
print(f"a: {type(a)} {a}")
print(f"b: {type(b)} {b}")
print(f"c: {type(c)} {c}")
print()

d = False  # boolean
e = True   # boolean
print(f"d: {type(d)} {d}")
print(f"e: {type(e)} {e}")
print()

f = 15     # int
g = 7.62   # float
h = f + g  # int plus float makes float
print(f"f: {type(f)} {f}")
print(f"g: {type(g)} {g}")
print(f"h: {type(h)} {h}")
print()

i = "True"   # string because of the surrounding quotes
j = "2.718"  # string because of the surrounding quotes
print(f"i: {type(i)} {i}")
print(f"j: {type(j)} {j}")


# Example 2

# The input function always returns a string.
k = input("Please enter a number: ")        # string
m = input("Please enter another number: ")  # string
n = k + m          # string plus string makes string
print(f"k: {type(k)} {k}")
print(f"m: {type(m)} {m}")
print(f"n: {type(n)} {n}")
print()

# The int and float functions convert a string to a number.
p = int(input("Please enter a number: "))          # int
q = float(input("Please enter another number: "))  # float
r = p + q                     # int plus float makes float
print(f"p: {type(p)} {p}")
print(f"q: {type(q)} {q}")
print(f"r: {type(r)} {r}")


''' Operator Precedence '''

# Example 3
# Given the distance that a cable will span and the distance
# it will sag or dip in the middle, this program computes the
# length of the cable.

# Get user input and convert it from
# strings to floating point numbers.
span = float(input("Distance the cable must span in meters: "))
dip = float(input("Distance the cable will sag in meters: "))

# Use the numbers to compute the cable length.
length = span + (8 * dip**2) / (3 * span)

# Print the cable length in the
# console window for the user to see.
print(f"Length of cable in meters: {length:.2f}")


''' Shorthand Operators '''
# **=  *=  /=  //=  %=  +=  -=
# Example 4
# Compute the total price of a pizza.

# The base price of a large pizza is $10.95
price = 10.95

# Ask the user for the number of toppings.
number_of_toppings = int(input("How many toppings? "))

# Compute the cost of the toppings.
price_per_topping = 1.45
toppings_cost = number_of_toppings * price_per_topping

# Add the cost of the toppings to the price of the pizza.
price += toppings_cost

# Print the price for the user to see.
print(f"Price: ${price:.2f}")



''' if … elif … else Statements '''

# Example 6

# Get an account balance as a number from the user.
balance = float(input("Enter the account balance: "))

# If the balance is greater than 500, then
# compute and add interest to the balance.
if balance > 500:
    interest = balance * 0.03
    balance += interest

# Print the balance.
print(f"balance: {balance:.2f}")

# Example 7

# Get the cost of an item from the user.
cost = float(input("Please enter the cost: "))

# Determine a discount rate based on the cost.
if cost < 100:
    rate = 0.10
elif cost < 250:
    rate = 0.15
elif cost < 400:
    rate = 0.18
else:
    rate = 0.20

# Compute the discount amount
# and the discounted cost.
discount = cost * rate
cost -= discount

# Print the discounted cost for the user to see.
print(f"After the discount, you will pay {cost:.2f}")

''' Logical Operators '''
# OR / AND
driver = input("Driver age: ")
passenger = input("Passenger age: ")
if driver >= 54 or (driver >= 32 and passenger >= 54):
    message = "Enjoy the ride!"
